# MyBuddy

## Introduction:
MyBuddy is a professional platform designed to diagnose and assist individuals in the context of psychotic disorders. The project incorporates various assessment tools, including the SRQ20 developed by the World Health Organization (WHO), PHQ9, and GAD7 developed by Pfizer. Additionally, the platform utilizes facial analysis for mood detection. It also provides a "Consult a Psychiatrist" section, offering well-organized information about different psychiatrists. Furthermore, MyBuddy includes a "Tasks" section where stress buster activities are suggested to the users.

## Empowering Mental Health Care:
The journey towards mental well-being can often be hindered by social stigmas and barriers that prevent individuals from seeking professional help. MyBuddy stands as a beacon of hope, aiming to break down those barriers and empower users to take charge of their mental health. By providing a comprehensive platform for self-assessment, MyBuddy offers a safe and confidential space for individuals worldwide to introspect and evaluate their mental well-being.

We understand the complexities and challenges that accompany mental health concerns. MyBuddy strives to create an environment of empathy, understanding, and support. We want every user to feel validated, heard, and understood as they navigate their own unique mental health journeys. By fostering awareness and understanding about common mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, and mental stress, MyBuddy equips users with knowledge and resources to better comprehend their experiences.

Through the amalgamation of assessment tools, mood detection, psychiatrist consultation, and stress buster activities, MyBuddy endeavors to provide a holistic approach to mental health care. Our platform is not just about generating reports or suggesting tasks; it's about fostering a culture of self-care and nurturing mental well-being. We believe that everyone deserves access to reliable mental health resources, regardless of social stigmas or geographical limitations.

Together, let's destigmatize mental health, raise awareness, and create a supportive community that embraces and celebrates each individual's unique path to healing and happiness. MyBuddy is here to be your companion, providing guidance, understanding, and encouragement every step of the way.

### Design & Implementation Constraints

1. Verification of Psychiatrists:

2. Data:
   The data of the pyschiatrists is fake data generated using [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/) to be legally compliant.
